Now Since we have all development tools and Angular Material installed.<br/>
We will start working on our pages.<br/>
In this section, We will introudce basic animation techniques which we can use in page transitions.

This part is entirely optional, because it's not an animation tutorial and may not be required.<br/>
It's just some cool trick which gives very nice and look and feel to your app.<br/>

It's worth including this in your project.<br/>
